# World-Cup-winner-predictor  
Imagine being able to predict which team will win during a match. All your bets would win and you'd be rich! Unfortunately, football, like any sport, is unpredictable, especially at the World Cup.
An attempt to build such an ML model is doomed to failure, the only question is how much? The project's task is to predict the winner of a given match.

The model is based on a classical machine learning approach, i.e., the use of supervised models. I trained the model on official FIFA data, which consisted of historical match results played by teams in FIFA's past. The entire project aimed to explore the limitations of conventional ML algorithms and to demonstrate that sports can be unpredictable :)
